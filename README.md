# My Personal Website for 2017

After graduating from the Udacity Front-End Web Development Nanodegree, this is my firts personal project. I decided to make my own personal website where I can experiment with differente technologies and also where customer and/or employers can contact take a peek of my job, have a better idea of who I am and what I can do and finally contact me.

This is a work in progress project, so expect it to be updated constantly.
